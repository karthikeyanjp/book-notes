# Steal like an Artist

- The world is full of things worth stealing and things that aren’t. Nothing is original. Everything is derived work on past ideas and people before you.
- Loose the thought that you have to be original. Embrace being influenced by other people and ideas. All ideas are a mix and a re-mix of ideas.
- Be picky about what you love. Surround yourself with good people. Your idea is about as best as the ideas of 5 people you are surrounding yourself with.
- Build your tree - Pick someone you like. Learn everything about them. Learn about the three thinker that person liked. Learn about them and keep repeating. And when it’s time, build your branch.
- Have a notebook of ideas, Keep a swipe file (things worth stealing).

# Write the book you want to read

- Make the things that you want to use. Write something that you want to read.

- Practice productive procrastination - take time off to stare at the walls, do boring chores. Ideas will pop up at random times.
- your hobby doesn’t have to generate money. it just has to amuse you.
