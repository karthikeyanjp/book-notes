[‎The Engineering Leadership Podcast: Scaling your leadership 10x in 6 years and leading outside your technical depth w/ Claus Moberg #105 on Apple Podcasts](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-engineering-leadership-podcast/id1481996448?i=1000586307103)

# Key Takeaways
- Your product is as good as the team building it.
- IC mindset in a EM role doesn’t scale. You have to enable the team to accomplish business values than doing it yourself.
- Coming from an IC background helps being an EM as you can contribute in the deepest level of discussions.
- Lack of domain knowledge isn’t a roadblock to engage in meaningful conversations at depth.  You understand the problem, break it down, remove the jargons and be the interpreter to understand the problem.  Ask questions, talk both up and down the hierarchy in the team.
- Navigate the problem by removing the jargons and have a deep understanding of the problem. Do whatever it takes to understand the problem - talk to people.
